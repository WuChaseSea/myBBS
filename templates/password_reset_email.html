Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{ email }}.
Follow the link below:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

In case you forget your Lover username: {{ user.username }}

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and pastt the URL in a mew brower window instead.

If you've reveived this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered your email address by mistake while trying ti reset a passwprd, If you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely disregard this email.

Thanks,

Lover
